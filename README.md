# Python RFC 3339 implementation

Implementation of the majority of
<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt>. Provides an implementation of
`tzinfo` for UTC (why isn't this in the standard library?) as well as
various parsing and formatting routines based on RFC 3339's syntax for
dates and times.

Use datetime.datetime.isoformat() as an inverse of the various parsing
routines in this module.

This library sticks quite closely to the RFC 3339 profile of ISO
8601. If that's too strict for you, and you need something for parsing
more general ISO 8601 dates and times, you might find
[pyiso8601](https://github.com/micktwomey/pyiso8601) (in debian as package
[`python-iso8601`](http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=python-iso8601))
useful.

## Examples and documentation

See the docstrings in the rfc3339 module source code itself.

## Limitations and potential improvements

Limitations, with respect to RFC 3339:

 - Section 4.3, "Unknown Local Offset Convention", is not implemented.

 - Section 5.6, "Internet Date/Time Format", is the ONLY supported format
   implemented by the various parsers in this module. (Section 5.6 is
   reproduced in its entirety below.)

 - Section 5.7, "Restrictions", is left to the datetime.datetime constructor
   to implement, with the exception of limits on timezone
   minutes-east-of-UTC magnitude. In particular, leap seconds are not
   addressed by this module. (And it appears that they are not supported
   by datetime, either.)

Potential Improvements:

 - Support for leap seconds. (There's a table of them in RFC 3339
   itself, and <http://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/grp50/leapsecond.cfm>
   <!-- used to be http://tf.nist.gov/pubs/bulletin/leapsecond.htm -->
   is supposed to update monthly.)
